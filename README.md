# Multiobjective Fuzzy Genetics-based Machine Learning(MoFGBML) Visualizer


MoFGBML is a machine learning algorithm which generates fuzzy classifiers which are able to classify the data using fuzzy rules.
Due to the nature of fuzzy classifiers there exists an interpretability-accuracy tradeoff so we can formulate the creation of classifiers as a multi-objective optimization problem. In this case, we optimize interpretability (minimize number of fuzzy rules) and optimize accuracy (minimize error rate).

This visualizer displays different datasets and the generated fuzzy classifiers to better visualize the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.
